                        (GRACE-FO) mission is a partnership between NASA and the <br>
                        German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ). GRACE-FO<br>
                         is a successor to the original GRACE mission, which operated <br>
                         from April 2002 through July 2017. Since June 2018, GRACE-<br>
                         FO carries on the extremely successful work of its <br>
                         predecessor while testing a new technology designed to <br>
                         dramatically improve the already remarkable precision of its <br>
                         measurement system.
                        <br>
                    <br>
                <br>
                The GRACE missions measure small month-to-month variations in gravity <br>
                over Earth's surface arising from the constant redistribution of mass.<br>
                 Changes in how mass is distributed within and between Earth’s atmosphere, <br>
                 oceans, groundwater and ice sheets are fundamental indicators of the large-<br>
                 scale dynamics of the planet. Monitoring changes in ice sheets and glaciers, <br>
                 near-surface and underground water storage, the amount of water in large <br>
                 lakes and rivers, as well as changes in sea level and ocean currents provides <br>
                 an integrated global view of how Earth’s water cycle and energy balance <br>
                 are evolving — measurements that have far-reaching impact on our <br>
                 understanding of the Earth system and important applications for everyday <br>
                 life. In addition to tracking mass change, each of the two satellites uses GPS<br>
                  antennas to supply at least 200 profiles of atmospheric temperature <br>
                  distribution and water vapor content daily to aid in the monitoring and <br>
                  orecasting of weather.

                  GRACE ended its science mission in October 2017. <br>
                  The GRACE Follow-On mission, planned for launch in April 2018,<br> will extend GRACE's innovative measurements.</p>
